                Are you planning on going on an Arizona road trip soon? If so, you have a lot of options ahead of you – with big cities, beautiful National and state parks, and various climates, you will have plenty to do.
            </p>
            <p>
                But what should you start with? How are you ever going to narrow your road trip options down?
            </p>
            <p>
                With this guide, you’ll know the top ten things to see when you visit Arizona!
            </p>
            <hr class="new5">
            <h2>1. The Petrified Forest</h2>
            <p>
                The Petrified Forest National Park doesn’t actually look like a forest. It’s full of rocky mounds similar to the Badlands, petroglyphs, and paleontology exhibits.
            </p>
            <p>
                So don’t let the word “forest” deceive you!
            </p>
            <p>
                This is an easy day trip option and also super easy to get to! All you have to do is get off the highway since it is right next to Highway 40 for a quick detour if you are <a href="https://www.ggandd.com/blog/where-can-i-get-a-travel-id-in-arizona/">driving across the state</a>.

            <h2>2. Canyon de Chelly</h2>
            <p>
                You may or may not have heard of Canyon de Chelly, but it is not to be missed as part of your travel plans in Arizona.
            </p>
            <p>
                This canyon is absolutely beautiful, vast, and awe-inspiring. It’s a National Monument located in Apache County in the northeastern corner of Arizona.
            </p>
            <p>
                The sandstone walls that create the cliffs are over 900 meters high, and within the canyon, you can see all sorts of vegetation native to the area.
            </p>
            <p>
                Canyon De Chelly takes up over 25 miles in Arizona, a twisting and winding maze of canyons and cliffs that you could spend days exploring.
            </p>
            <hr class="new5">
            <h2>3. The Grand Canyon</h2>
            <p>
                The Grand Canyon. You’ve definitely heard of that one before.
            </p>
            <p>
                As one of Arizona’s National Parks, the Grand Canyon is definitely one of the most known ones – and the most popular. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether you choose to drive to the edge and look over it or take a hike down inside the inner part of the canyon to spend a night, you won’t regret going.
            </p>
            <p>
                And if you have the time, you’ll definitely want to spend a night in the Canyon…it’s an experiment you’ll never forget as part of your Arizona road trip.
            </p>
            <hr class="new5">
            <h2>4. Havasupai Falls</h2>
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/havasupai.htm">Havasupai Falls</a> is actually a waterfall located near the Grand Canyon in the Havasupai Indian Reservation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Why is this waterfall so spectacular?
            </p>
            <p>
                Because the blue-green waters of the fall contrast significantly with the red rocks of the canyons and cliffs surrounding it – a sight that has so much grandeur and curiosity in it.
            </p>
            <hr class="new5">
            <h2>5. Page and Lake Powell Area</h2>
            <p>
                The Page and Lake Powell area have so much that you can do and explore. You could make this a trip on its own!
            </p>
            <p>
                Here are a few things you’ll want to see in the area:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Antelope Canyon</li>
                <li>Horseshoe Bend</li>
                <li>Glen Canyon Dam</li>
                <li>Water Holes Canyon</li>
                <li>White Pockets</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Be sure to spend your time exploring this area! You could spend days and weeks here and not see it all. You also don’t want to go to this area without doing a great hike either!
            </p>
            <hr class="new5">
            <h2>6. Monument Valley</h2>
            <p>
                Monument Valley is a National Monument in the Monument Valley Navajo Tribal Park. It is a monument of sandstone towers that climb to over 1,000 feet in some areas. 
            </p>
            <p>
                These pinnacles are surrounded by flat land for miles, so the majestic beauty of seeing something like this will astonish you. Not to mention, there are beautiful colors all around you with the dark reds of the cliffs and the deep greens in the trees.
            </p>
            <p>
                To visit, the 17-mile loop road is the perfect way to see it all in about an hour or two depending on how much you stop to take photos! 
            </p>
            <hr class="new5">
            <h2>7. Bisbee</h2>
            <p>
                The town of Bisbee is perfect for any creative or artsy person out there looking for things to do in Arizona.
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <hr class="new5">
            <h2>9. Tombstone</h2>
            <p>
                If you want to transport yourself back in time to the wild, Wild West, then Tombstone is the place for you.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are many exhibits you can see at Tombstone Courthouse State Historic Park. There’s also a corral outdoor theater that reenacts cowboy gunfights.

            </p>
            <hr class="new5">
            <h2>10. Old Town Scottsdale</h2>
            <p>
                If you’re looking for something a little less of a nature vibe and more on par with upscale boutiques and fine dining, you’ll find that in Scottsdale.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because it is right outside of Phoenix, you are close to a large city with plenty to do. Not only that, but you are also close to a ton of outdoor recreation sites as well like Camelback Mountain in Phoenix.
            </p>
